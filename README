CraigsLister Program

This is a simple program I made to find Craigslist listings for apartments or
rooms that are available in Salt Lake City, Utah. It searches for it based on
a price range you define and then sorts through those, throwing out listings
which contain terms/phrases that you define in the ignore_list list. Any new
listings that it finds that is in your price range AND does not contain any
of the phrases that you have will be emailed to you. It searches the listings 
every 30 minutes as to not stress the servers, give people reasonable time to 
make a new post, and to give you a little break to do other things. If you 
want to use it, be sure to change the parameters in the SendEmail function so 
that it has your gmail username, password, and the email address to send it to. 

If your gmail account is failing to connect, try allowing "less secure apps"
to access your gmail account 
(https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps) and also there is
an "unlock captcha fix" at (https://accounts.google.com/displayunlockcaptcha).
On top of this, check your email and see if Google has notified you saying they
blocked an unknown app from accessing your account. You may have to follow the
link in that email to verify that it was you.

This should not violate any of Craigslist policies as it is the same as 
refreshing your web browser on the website. This program simply parses 
(ie "reads") the site for you once every 30 minutes.
